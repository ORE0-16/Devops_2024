Types of client server architecture -

1 tier - it contains only 1 server
2 tier - it contain multiple server local system - business logic layer(java+font end)  - DB

Working directory(git add)  - Staging area (git commit)- Repository (local repo ,central repo, remote repo)
	• Working Directory - After git installation files are available into it and you can edit the code , you can modify, and delete the code
	• Staging area - files transferred from working directory to staging area by using GIT ADD command
	• Repository - From staging area to repository we are going to send the files by using GIT commit command 
		○ Local Repo -  In local repo the developers will get the main code to make the changes , and push the changes the central repo
		○ Central Repo - here you can take the decision whether to proceed with the changes to final code repository 
		○ Remote repo - if the developer1 needs to share the code to other developer he ll create a remote repo and share with them
